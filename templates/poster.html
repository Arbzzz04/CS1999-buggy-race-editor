  <div class="task">
    <h2>0-GET: Get the source code</h2>
    <p>
      I forked the repository on GitHub and then used <code>git clone</code> to make a local copy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the repository was on my own machine, I was able to commit changes to version control as I went along and pushed them to my GitHub repository at the end of each day. I followed GitHub's instructions and set up an SSH key, so I didn't need to enter a username and password every time I pushed.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
    <h2>0-RUN: Get the app running and view it in a browser</h2>
    <p>
      After connecting to the workspace and entering my password, I was able to run the app.py file and view the webpage in a browser.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
    <h2>0-CHANGE: Make a change to a template and see it appear</h2>
    <p>
      I edited the title of the index.html web page to "Arbaaz's buggy editor," then refreshed the page and saw the change occur.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
    <h2>1-TEMPLATE: Add a new template to the app</h2>
    <p>
      I created an HTML file called "info" and copied the specifications from the buggy race server to my app. I hard-coded the tables and added CSS to style them.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
    <h2>1-ADD: Add more data to the form</h2>
    <p>
      I added a "flag_color" variable to be filled when creating a buggy and submitted it to the database in the app.py file.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
    <h2>1-VALID: Add basic data validation</h2>
    <p>
      I edited the app.py file and used the "isdigit()" method to verify that the input was a number. Then, I displayed an error message alongside the input box to show the field that was not entered correctly.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
    <h2>1-STYLE: Style your editor just how you like it</h2>
    <p>
      I added CSS styling to the main file called "app.css." I added features like changing the button color when hovering over it.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
    <h2>2-EDIT: Edit the record by loading its current values into the form</h2>
    <p>
      I edited the app.py file with the function "create_buggy()" and changed the "get" method to retrieve the data for the required fields. Then, I returned the values to be displayed in the web page and modified the HTML to populate the input boxes with the retrieved values.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
    <h2>2-FORM: Make the form better</h2>
    <p>
      I added a "hint" button next to the input field to provide a description and guide the user if the label was unclear. I used JavaScript to toggle the visibility of the description when the button is clicked.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
    <h2>2-COST: Calculate and save the game cost of the buggy</h2>
    <p>
      I added variables to the "init_db" file and created a new "database.db" file to store the new variable in the database. Then, I retrieved the inputs from the buggy form, used Python to calculate the costs, and updated the values for all the components, including the total cost, in the database.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
    <h2>2-RULES: Add validation according to the game rules</h2>
  
    <p>I have added some validation so far like checking for even numbers and checking if the colors are the same for the flag if the pattern is not plain. I also had to add the data fields to the form to allow the user to choose and warning to prompt the user to pick again. i had to add validation for the rest of the variables that i added too and configured them to match the rules of the game.</p>
  
</div>

  <div class="task">
    <h2>3-ENV: Switch between dev and production environments</h2>
    <p>
      I used the "python-dotenv" library in the app.py file and created a ".env" file to store the necessary information. I modified the program to switch between the development and production environments by editing the values in the ".env" file.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="task">
    <h2>3-AUTOFILL: Add auto-fill to the edit forms</h2>
    <p>
      I added a JavaScript function within the script tags to enable the user to autofill the remaining elements. By calling the "autofillValues()" function, predefined values were populated in the form fields.
    </p>
  </div>
